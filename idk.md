The ideal scenario to Lift state up in react js
Make blog app like this https://daveceddia.com/

<!-- Only pass the data you want to store or give -->
<!-- Form flow chart -->

## RTK
<!-- - createAsyncThunk -->
- createSlice and createReducer uses immer library to write "mutating" logic in reducers
  <!-- - immer: Create the next immutable state by mutating the current one -->
  <!--   "immutable data" that is ALWAYS safe to change -->
- Slice: initial-state, reducers, actions

<!-- give me slangs and some lines that are famouse in redux, like -->
<!-- you should never mutate your state -->
<!-- changes must be done using function (reducer) -->
