- Positioning allows us to take elements out of the normal document flow and make them behave differently

# Relative

- Moves the element relative to its original position within the document flow
- Used as a reference for absolute positioning

# Absolute = Exact

- Always positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (Ancestor with position: relative, absolute, or fixed)
- if no positioned ancestor exists, it will be positioned relative to the <html> or <body>

# Fixed - Use on nav

- Navigation menus should almost always be marked up as a <ul> list instead of a bunch of <div> elements

# Sticky

- Acts like a Fixed element when it reaches a defined point
- Only works when a top (or other offset) property is set

# Stacking Context & z-index - Moves on the z-axis

# Vocab

Offset: Displacement or a shift
