Adds helpful CSS hook
Don't use semantic elements just to use them. Incorrect usage is worse than not using them at all If unsure, use a <div> instead

<article> represents self-contained, independent content
<section> groups related content w/ common theme
<header> best practice to wrap the website's name/logo and main <nav>
- should be connected to their closest section, like <section>, <article>, or <nav>

Sectioning Elements
- helps search engines, screen readers and other tools to identify different parts of website
- also helps you as a developer keep your site organized

Each <h1> element creates a new section in the document outline, even when nested
- <h3> stays under <h2>
- changing <h3> to <h2> starts a new section and breaks the outline

Use semantic tags for meaningful content
Use <div> for
- layout or when no semantic tag fits
- purely presentational

Figures and Captions
- helps organize and describe content like images, diagrams, or code snippets
- use for SEO and accessibility, especially to replace detailed alt description
