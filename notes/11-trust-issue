Never fully trust setTimeout:
- it runs only after all other functions finish, even if the timer has expired
- it all depends on callstack

What if timeout = 0sec ?
- setTimeout(fn, 0) schedules fn to run as soon as the call stack is empty

The First Rule of JS:
- never block the main thread; use async "setTimeout" for time-consuming tasks
- JS has one call stack that's the beauty of single-threaded languages

# Terms
Concurrency model of JS: event-loop waits for call stack to be empty before running tasks
DOM Breakpoints: used to pause code execution at specific points during DOM interactions

# Vocab
Defer: postpone
