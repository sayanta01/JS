Async programming in JavaScript exists because callback exits
Good Part of callback - Callback are super important while writing asynchronous code in JS

# api.createOrder(cart, function () {
#   api.proceedToPayment(function () {
#     api.showOrderSummary(function () {
#       api.updateWallet();
#     });
#   });
# });

Inversion of Control: Giving control to someone else (which can be risky)
- You lose the control of code when using callback
- When we pass a function as a callback, basically we are dependant on our parent function that it is his responsibility to run that function
  This is called `inversion of control` because we are dependant on that function
  What if parent function stopped working, what if it was developed by another programmer or callback runs two times or never run at all

- Moral of the story never depend to anyone.
