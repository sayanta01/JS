Function that "remembers" variables from its lexical scope
Closure = function  it's Lex Env - function bundled along with it's lexical scope
- Allows function to access variables from its parent scope, even after the parent function has finished running

# function outer() {
#   const message = "Hello from outer!";
#
#   function inner() {
#     console.log(message);
#   }
#
#   return inner;
# }
#
# const myFunc = outer();  // Step 1
# myFunc();                // Step 2

You call outer()
 ↓
outer() runs:
  - Creates variable: message = "Hello from outer!"
  - Defines function: inner()
  - RETURNS inner() (but doesn't call it yet)
 ↓
outer() is DONE (execution finishes)
 ↓
BUT WAIT: The returned inner() still REMEMBERS "message"!
 ↓
You call myFunc() (which is inner())
 ↓
inner() runs:
- it PRINTS "Hello from outer!" because it remembers message!

# function x() {
#   var a = 7;
#   function y() {
#     console.log(a);
#   }
#   return y; // function returns with its surrounding scope attached (y  lexical scope)
# }
# var z = x();
# console.log(z); // z holds the entire function y, including its lexical scope

Advantages of Closure:
- Data hiding & Encapsulation
- Module Design Pattern
- Memoization - Saving function results to avoid re-computing
- Curring - Transforming
- setTimeout & Asynchronous Programming

Disadvantages of Closure:
- Memory Consumption
- Potential for Memory Leaks

# Terms
Object: group related data & properties
Symbol: unique identifier for object properties
