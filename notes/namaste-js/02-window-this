Global Object
- "window" in browser
- "global" in node.js

SHORTEST JS Program:
Even in an empty file, the JS engine:
- creates the Global Execution Context
- sets up Global Memory # var-env

Global Scope: "this" == "window" global object, holds all global variables/functions
- global functions/variables are properties of the global object

inner functions: "this" won’t refer to the global object unless explicitly set

Strict mode: "this" will be `undefined` if not explicitly bound in functions
Non-strict mode: "this" refers to the global object unless explicitly bound

"use strict" prevents using undeclared variables
Non-strict mode allows undeclared variables and other relaxed rules

# Terms
Activation Object: holds function-specific data (parameters, declarations, variables and this value) during execution

# 6-undefined vs not defined ---------------------------------------------------
undefined = placeholder until a variable gets a value
JS is loosely-typed language and doesn't attach variables to any datatype
