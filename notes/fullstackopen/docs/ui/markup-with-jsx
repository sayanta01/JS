- Keep related logic & markup together ensures that they stay in sync with each other on every edit
- Details that are unrelated should be isolated from each other
  Making it safer to change either of them on their own

The Rules of JSX:
1. Return a single root element 
- To return multiple elements from a component, wrap them with a single parent tag

Why do multiple JSX tags need to be wrapped? 
! JSX looks like HTML, but under the hood it is transformed into plain JavaScript objects
  You canâ€™t return two objects from a function without wrapping them into an array

2. Close all the tags
- JSX requires tags to be explicitly closed:
  self-closing tags like <img> must become <img />, and wrapping tags like <li>oranges must be written as <li>oranges</li>

3. camelCase all most of the things!
- JSX turns into JavaScript and attributes written in JSX become keys of JavaScript object properties
  Use className instead of class to avoid JavaScript conflicts
- For historical reasons, aria-* and data-* attributes are written as in HTML with dashes
