Using curly braces: A window into the JavaScript world
- Let you bring JavaScript logic and variables into your markup

Using “double curlies”: CSS and other objects in JSX
- In addition to strings, numbers, and other JavaScript expressions, you can even pass objects in JSX
  Objects are also denoted with curly braces, like { name: "Hedy Lamarr", inventions: 5 }
  to pass a JS object in JSX, you must wrap the object in another pair of curly braces: person={{ name: "Hedy Lamarr", inventions: 5 }}
- The next time you see {{ and }} in JSX, know that it’s nothing more than an object inside the JSX curlies!
