When you're building a SPA (update only what changes) or something that feels like an application rather than a document

# HTML

<details> <dialog> mailto link

# State management isn't a luxury, it's a fucking necessity

# Components

- Remember when you copied and pasted that same navigation bar HTML into 30 different pages
  then had to update it in 30 different places because the client wanted a new fucking link?
  Yeah, fucking brilliant. You probably felt like a goddamn genius
- Frameworks like React force you to think in terms of reusable, encapsulated components
  Build a button once, style it once, add its logic once, and then reuse that beautiful bastard everywhere
  Change it in one place, and it updates everywhere. This isn't just convenience; it's fucking sanity at scale

# Smarter ui updates

- Remember trying to manually update a dozen different parts of your page whenever one piece of data changed?
- Frameworks are built to be clever about this shit. You tell them what your ui should look like based on your data

# Just use semantic HTML

- Real accessibility for complex widgets means meticulous aria attributes robust focus management, and proper keyboard navigation
- Frameworks let you build an accessible component once, nail all that shit, and then reuse it

# Terms

tree-shaking
code-splitting: only load the JS you need, not the whole goddamn phonebook
lazy-loading
state propagation: process of passing state down and updating it back up
