#
Technically the component is defined as a JavaScript function
Core philosophy of React is composing applications from many specialized reusable components

Props: passing data to components:
- The props sent by the component App are the values of the variables, the result of the evaluation of the sum expression and a regular string

Do not render objects:
- Objects are not valid as a React child
  The individual things rendered in braces must be primitive values, such as numbers or strings
  React also allows arrays to be rendered if the array contains values that are eligible for rendering (such as numbers or strings)

- The only way to go fast, is to go well - "Uncle Bob"
- Careful progress with small steps is even the only way to be fast - "Martin Fowler"

! Place the objects into an [Array]
  Do not pass different objects as separate props from the App component to the components Content and Total
  Instead, pass them directly as an array
