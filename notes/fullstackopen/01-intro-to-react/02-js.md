# Node.js - JavaScript runtime environment based on Google's Chrome V8 JavaScript engine and works practically anywhere - from servers to phones
Variables:
- const does not define a variable but a constant for which the value can no longer be changed
  On the other hand, let defines a normal variable
- Scope monster
`for(var i = 0; i<10; i++) {
  console.log(i)
}
console.log(i)`

Arrays:
- push(Modifies the original array)
`const t = [1, -1, 3];
t.push(5);
console.log(t[1]);
// forEach calls the function for each of the items in the array, always passing the individual item as an argument
t.forEach((value) => {
  console.log(value);
});`

- concat(Creates a new array with the added item, original array remains unchanged)
`const t = [1, -1, 3];
const t2 = t.concat(5);
console.log(t);
console.log(t2);`

- map(Creates a new array by applying a function to each item of the original array)
`const t = [1, 2, 3];
const m1 = t.map((value) => value * 2);
console.log(m1);`

- Individual items of an array are easy to assign to variables with the help of the destructuring assignment
`const t = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const [first, second, ...rest] = t;
console.log(first, second);
console.log(rest);`

Objects:
Object literals, listing properties within braces
- The values of the properties can be of any type, like integers, strings, arrays, objects...
  Referenced by using the "dot" notation, or by using brackets

Functions:
- If there is just a single parameter, we can exclude the parentheses from the definition
`const square = p => {
  console.log(p);
  return p * p;
};`

- If the function only contains a single expression then the braces are not needed
`const square = p => p * p`

- This form is particularly handy when manipulating arrays - e.g. when using the map method:
`const t = [1, 2, 3]
const tSquared = t.map(p => p * p)`

- Pro-tip: you may run into issues when it comes to the structure of the props that components receive
  A good way to make things more clear is by printing the props to the console, e.g. as follows:
`const Header = (props) => {
  console.log(props)
  return <h1>{props.course}</h1>
}`
- Place the objects into an [Array]
  Do not pass different objects as separate props from the App component to the components Content and Total
  Instead, pass them directly as an array

Object methods and `this`:
- We can assign methods to an object by defining properties that are functions:
`const arto = {
  name: 'Arto Hellas',
  age: 35,
  greet: function() {
    console.log('hello, my name is ' + this.name)
  },
}`
- Methods can be assigned to objects even after the creation of the object:
`arto.growOlder = function() {
  this.age += 1
}`

- When calling the method through a reference, the method loses knowledge of what the original `this` was
  in JavaScript the value of this is defined based on how the method is called
- When calling the method through a reference, the value of this becomes the so-called
  global object and the end result is often not what the software developer had originally intended
`const referenceToGreet = arto.greet
referenceToGreet() // prints "hello, my name is undefined"`

- There are several mechanisms by which the original this can be preserved. One of these is using a method called bind:
`setTimeout(arto.greet.bind(arto), 1000);`
- Calling arto.greet.bind(arto) creates a new function where `this` is bound to point to Arto
  independent of where and how the method is being called and always calls the original function with `this`

Using arrow functions it is possible to solve some of the problems related to this
- Arrow functions inherit `this` from their surrounding scope, so it works!

<!-- Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines execute -->
`class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name
    this.age = age
  }
  greet() {
    console.log('hello, my name is ' + this.name)
  }
}
const adam = new Person('Adam Ondra', 29)
adam.greet()
const janja = new Person('Janja Garnbret', 23)
janja.greet()`
