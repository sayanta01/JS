- Add user authentication and authorization to application
- Users should be stored in the database and every note should be linked to the user who created it
- Deleting and editing a note should only be allowed for the user who created it

# Managing Relationship in Document Database üí°
## Problem: Traditionally, document databases do not support join queries like relational databases
## Solution: Use references across collections to simulate relationships
- Document databases do not demand the foreign key to be stored
- Paradoxically, schema-less databases require developers to make far more radical design decisions
  about data organization at the beginning of the project than relational databases with schemas

# Mongoose schema for users
## References should be stored in both documents
- The note references the user who created it
- The user has an array of references to all the notes they created

# Creating users & Storing passwords
https://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/
- Never store unencrypted passwords in plain text (use one-way hash function)
- Just use `bcrypt` for hash your password (slow hashing algorithm makes brute-force attacks harder)
## Problem: Ensure each user has a unique username
## Solution: Make sure there are no duplicate usernames already in the database
- First, find and delete any duplicates usernames
- Then, let the unique rule work properly
- Finally, handle errors nicely
- Key Point: You can't create a "no duplicates" rule if duplicates already exist
```
You:      unique: true
             ‚Üì
Mongoose: Pass it on
             ‚Üì
MongoDB:  Does the actual work (creates a unique index)
```
## Index violation: You added a rule, but your data already breaks it
- You're telling MongoDB: Hey, don't let anyone have the same username!
- But MongoDB says: I can't create that rule, you've already broken it!

- Create new feature then test it (TDD) tests for new functionality are written before the functionality is implemented
  * Takes much less effort to write automated tests, and it will make the development of our application much easier
- Make new users in a production or development environment
  * Send a POST request to /api/users/

# Creating a new note
<!-- - The code for creating a new note has to be updated so that the note is assigned to the user who created it -->
<!--   So that the information about the user who created a note is sent in the userId field of the request body -->
- Save the new note > Attach it to the user's notes[] (user who created it)

<!-- - We can see that the user has two notes -->
<!-- - Likewise, the ids of the users who created the notes can be seen when we visit the route for fetching all notes: -->
<!-- Due to the changes we made, the tests no longer pass, but we leave fixing the tests as an optional exercise -->
<!-- We will fix the frontend in part 5 of the course -->

# Populate: Lets you reference documents in other collections
- Fill the specified paths in the document with documents from other collections
- We would like our API to work in such a way, that when an HTTP GET request is made to the /api/users route
  the user objects would also contain the contents of the user's notes and not just their id
## Problem: Document databases do not properly support join queries between collections
## Solution: Mongoose accomplishes the join by doing multiple queries (populate method)
- Different from join queries in relational databases which are transactional
  meaning that the state of the database does not change during the time that the query is made
- With join queries in Mongoose, nothing can guarantee that the state between the collections being joined is consistent

- Use the populate method for choosing the fields you want to include from the documents
  `const users = await User.find({}).populate("notes", { content: 1, important: 1 })`
- The functionality of the populate method of Mongoose is based on the fact that ‚ö†Ô∏è
  we have defined "types" to the references in the Mongoose schema with the ref option
