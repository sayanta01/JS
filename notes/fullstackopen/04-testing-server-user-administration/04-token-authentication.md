<!-- - Users must be able to log into our application -->
<!-- - And when a user is logged in their user information must automatically be attached to any new notes they create -->

![Token-Based Authentication](https://fullstackopen.com/static/259c9dce6b3d1d77bedb04e799ac7dd3/5a190/16new.png)

## How JWT Works
- JWT looks random, but it's a SECRET BOX with user info inside!
Example: https://jwt.io/#Debugger
- When you login, we CREATE the token
  * We put user data INSIDE the token
- When you make a request, we DECODE the token
  * We get the user data FROM INSIDE the token

# First implement the functionality for logging in `jsonwebtoken`
<!-- - Find username -->
<!-- - Compare password -->
<!-- - if correct > Generate token -->

# Problem: Only allow logged-in users to create new notes (i.e. have a valid token)
- Change creating new notes so that it is only possible if the post request has a valid token attached
  * The note is then saved to the notes list of the user identified by the token
- Why: To securely identify the logged-in user making the request
## Solution: Only users with a valid JWT can create notes
```üí°
Gets the token from request headers (Token says: i'm user #123)
            ‚Üì
Verifies it using process.env.SECRET (Database check: "does user #123 actually exist?)
(checks if it's valid and untampered)
            ‚Üì
if invalid > return 401 error || if valid > gives you decoded user data (e.g., user id) (if yes: You're authenticated!)
```

# Problems of Token-based authentication
## Solution: Token Expiration & Refresh Token Mechanism
- Once the API user, eg. React app gets token, the API has a blind trust to the token holder
  What if the access rights of the token holder should be revoked? There are two solutions
  - The easier one is to limit the validity period of a token
    * The error handling middleware should be extended to give a proper error in the case of an expired token
  - The other solution is to save info about each token to the backend database
    * With this scheme, access rights can be revoked at any time (server-side session)
- JWT must be transmitted over HTTPS to avoid interception
- Token-based > Vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting
  * React sanitizes all text that it renders, meaning it is not executing the rendered content as JS
- httpOnly cookies > Vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery

# End notes
- We will leave fixing the tests to a non-compulsory exercise
<!-- - We will implement login to the frontend in the next part -->

# Full Lifecycle of Authentication
## Register
User provide username/password
    ‚Üì
Server hashes password with bcrypt and saves user to database
    ‚Üì
Send 201 response to client
## Login
User send username/password
    ‚Üì
Server finds user and checks password using bcrypt.compare()
- if invalid, send 401 response to client
- if valid, generates JWT token with user's ID, and send token to client
    ‚Üì
- Client store it in (localStorage or React state)
## Access Protected Routes (Authorization) üöÇ
Client send token in the Authorization header (Bearer <token>)
    ‚Üì
Server extract and verifies token with jwt.verify() (tokenExtractor)
- if valid, extract user ID > Attach to request object (userExtractor)
    ‚Üì
Grant access to route handler

## Extra
- Routes need to identify who's making the request (DRY)
- Access Control Models (like Role-Based Access Control)
- Email Verification & OAuth

# Full Error-handling Lifecycle
## How to handle errors?
üî∏ Use try/catch with next(error) inside routes > Pass errors to centralized middleware üêû
üî∏ Or Just use express-async-errors to auto-forward async errors to errorHandler middleware

## Exercise
- Don't validate password with Mongoose ‚Äî use Express instead (the controller)
- JWT is not related to password; bcrypt is

# Vocab
Bearer: Thing that carries or holds something (authentication scheme)
Revoked: Cancelled
