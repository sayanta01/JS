- Users must be able to log into our application
- And when a user is logged in their user information must automatically be attached to any new notes they create

![Token-Based Authentication](https://fullstackopen.com/static/259c9dce6b3d1d77bedb04e799ac7dd3/5a190/16new.png)

## How JWT Works
- JWT looks random, but it's a SECRET BOX with user info inside!
Real Example: https://jwt.io/#Debugger
- When you login, we CREATE the token
  * We put user data INSIDE the token
- When you make a request, we DECODE the token
  * We get the user data FROM INSIDE the token

# First implement the functionality for logging in `jsonwebtoken`
- Find username
- Compare password
- if correct > Generate token

# Problem: Only allow logged-in users to create new notes (i.e. have a valid token)
- Change creating new notes so that it is only possible if the post request has a valid token attached
  * The note is then saved to the notes list of the user identified by the token
- Why: To securely identify the logged-in user making the request
## Solution: Only users with a valid JWT can create notes
```ðŸ’¡
Gets the token from request headers (Token says: i'm user #123)
            â†“
Verifies it using process.env.SECRET (Database check: "does user #123 actually exist?)
(checks if it's valid and untampered)
            â†“
if invalid > return 401 error || if valid > gives you decoded user data (e.g., user id) (if yes: You're authenticated!)
```

# Problems of Token-based authentication
- Once the API user, eg. a React app gets a token, the API has a blind trust to the token holder
  What if the access rights of the token holder should be revoked? There are two solutions
  - The easier one is to limit the validity period of a token
    * The error handling middleware should be extended to give a proper error in the case of an expired token
  - The other solution is to save info about each token to the backend database
    * With this scheme, access rights can be revoked at any time (server-side session)
- JWT must be transmitted over HTTPS to avoid interception

# End notes
- We will leave fixing the tests to a non-compulsory exercise
<!-- - We will implement login to the frontend in the next part -->

# Full Lifecycle of Authentication
## Register
- User provides username/password
- Server hashes password with bcrypt and saves to database
- Send success response to client
## Login
- User sends username/password
- Server finds user and checks password using bcrypt.compare()
- if valid, generate JWT token with user's ID
- Send token to client
## Access Protected Routes ðŸš‚
- Client sends token in Authorization header (Bearer <token>)
- Server verifies and decodes token with jwt.verify()
- if valid, extract user ID from token payload and grant access to route handler

# Vocab
Bearer: Thing that carries or holds something (authentication scheme)
Revoked: Cancelled
