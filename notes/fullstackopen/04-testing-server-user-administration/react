i want to know how does form works in react i want flow chart like Full Lifecycle of Forms in react


i have some exammples like

# Full Lifecycle of Express.js
Client sends HTTP request
        ↓
Express server receives request
        ↓
Middleware runs in order (global > route-specific) ℹ️
Run global middleware (parser, CORS)
        ↓
Match specific route (based on method and path)
if no match > send 404 response
if matched > execute route handler
        ↓
Run route-specific middleware > Authentication 🔐
if auth fails > send 401 response
if auth passes > proceed to route handler
        ↓
Execute route handler
        ↓
Process business logic (DB queries / validations) 🗄️>--------------------┐
if success > send response to client                                     |
if error > pass to error-handling middleware                             |
                                                                         |
# Full Lifecycle of MongoDB/Mongoose                                     |
Define Mongoose schema and model (validation, type-checking)             |
        ↓                                                                |
Connect to MongoDB (during app startup)                                  |
        ↓                                                                |
Express receives HTTP request (CRUD operation)                           |
        ↓                                                                ↓
A Mongoose query is created and executed using model (.find(), .save()) 🚂🔐
        ↓
Query runs inside route handler or service layer❗
        ↓
Mongoose compiles query and sends it to MongoDB
        ↓
MongoDB processes operation (find, insert, update, or delete)
        ↓
MongoDB returns result or error to Mongoose
        ↓
Mongoose formats result into JavaScript objects (documents)
        ↓
Express handles result or passes error to error-handling middleware  
        ↓
Express sends response to client


so i have to know the Full Lifecycle of Forms in react like this of mordern react i don't want classbased component

-------------------------------------------------------------


🧾 Full Lifecycle of Forms in React
User sees form on screen (component is mounted)
⬇
Initial state is set (e.g. useState for input values)
⬇
User types into form fields
⬇
onChange event triggers handler function
⬇
Handler updates component state with new input
⬇
React re-renders with updated input value (controlled input)
⬇
(Optional) Input validation runs (real-time or onBlur)
⬇
User clicks Submit button
⬇
onSubmit event handler is triggered
⬇
Prevent default browser submission (event.preventDefault())
⬇
Validate all inputs (synchronously or asynchronously)
if validation fails ⛔ → show errors, do not submit
if validation passes ✅ → proceed
⬇
(Optional) Prepare payload from state (trim, transform, etc.)
⬇
Send data to backend (e.g. using fetch or axios)
⬇
Await response from server
⬇
If success → show confirmation / redirect / reset form 🟢
If error → show error message / stay on form 🔴
⬇
(Optional) Reset form state (if needed)




is this the flow chart or modern react i don't want class based component
