# Understanding Virtual DOM
- Why the real DOM is slow for frequent updates: When you make changes to the real DOM
  it often triggers reflows and repaints of the webpage, which are computationally expensive operations
- Updating the real DOM is expensive:
  The DOM is a complex tree structure. When you update one element
  the browser needs to recalculate styles, layout, and sometimes re-render large parts of the page
  This process consumes CPU resources and can cause noticeable delays
- Virtual DOM: Just a JavaScript object
- React elements are just objects that are returned by React.createElement() function calls


# Understanding Fiber Tree
Fiber Tree: An internal data structure that implements React's reconciliation algorithm with advanced scheduling capabilities
- Think of the Fiber tree as "Virtual DOM with superpowers
- A linked list structure that enables incremental rendering and holds additional metadata

# Understanding Reconciliation and Diffing Algorithms
Reconciliation: The overall process React uses to update the UI following data changes
Diffing: A part of the reconciliation process - the algorithm that compares previous and new trees to determine the differences between them
- First Rule of Diffing Algorithm: Two elements of different types will produce different trees
  Different trees means different subtrees in the Virtual DOM/Fiber structure ðŸ’¡
  But what if React doesn't see a different element in the same position, but the same element?
  - The element will be kept in the tree (as well as its child elements and its state)
  - New props/attributes are passed if they changed between renders

- However, this isn't something that we always want. We actually want to "reset" the state even when it's the "same position, same element
  - How can we achieve this reset behavior? This is where the second rule of React's diffing algorithm comes into play
  - Elements with a different key prop do not remain the same across renders. And, elements with a stable key prop maintain their identity across renders


# What is the key prop?
- The key prop is a special property that we use to inform the diffing algorithm that an element is unique
  It allows React to distinguish between multiple instances of the same component type
  When the key changes between renders, the element will be destroyed and a new one created 
  (even if its position in the tree remains unchanged)
- Thanks to the key prop. React recognizes distinct two components, even though they occupy the same position across renders

There's also a second use case for the key prop:
- When a key value remains consistent across renders
- the element will be preserved in the DOM (even if its position changes in the tree changes)
- This is actually why we use the key prop in lists


# Recap:
- The render phase can be asynchronous, the commit phase is strictly synchronous!
- Figure out how the React Element will turn into an actual DOM Element?
- If you don't want the Child to re-render when parent component renders, then you can wrap the Child in React.memo()
- The component that writes the results to the actual DOM is a library called ReactDOM/React Native


<!-- how to add react to a normal html page? -->

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<!-- - create extension for blog or learning -->
<!--   when learning take short note/msg with adding color -->
<!--   like highligiting the sentence or word -->
<!-- - and preserver that note for the website -->
<!-- - also try to remove some parts or elemnts, if not just add strike-through -->
<!-- - means making the blog or learning webpage as note -->
