Approximations of how something works in your head are known as "mental models"
Intuitions (like "boxiness" of variables) influence how we read code our whole lives

# Coding, Fast and Slow
"fast" system is good at pattern matching and "gut reactions". But it’s not good at planning
"slow" system is responsible for complex step-by-step reasoning

Because using the “slow” system is so mentally draining, we tend to default to the
“fast” one—even when dealing with intellectual tasks like coding

When we use the “fast” system, we guess what the code does based on its overall
structure, naming conventions and comments. Using the “slow” system, we
retrace what the code does step by step—a tiring and time-consuming process

This is why having an accurate mental model is so important. Simulating a
computer in your head is hard, and when you have to fall back to the “slow”
thinking system, your mental model is all you can rely on. With the wrong mental
model, you’ll fundamentally misunderstand what to expect from your code, and all
your effort will be wasted

# Vocab
Introspect - examine one's own thoughts or feelings
Spatial - relating to space
Inferred - assumed
Laborious - requiring considerable time and effort

Mental model of how JavaScript works??
How variables, values, and object mutations really work:
- what happens in your mind when you see an assignment?
- what does nested object really mean?
- what can you do with different kinds of values?
- why do you sometimes get undefined, and sometimes a crash?
- why does changing one thing affect another thing?
- why aren’t two objects equal?
You’ll always make mistakes. We all do. That’s okay. The difference is that you will now see them
and a mistake you can see is a mistake you can fix
No need for guessing!!
